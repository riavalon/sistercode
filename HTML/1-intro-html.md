# HTML `===` Structure!

### HTML Tags

HTML uses what are called "tags" to build it's structure. A tag is comprised of what is called an "opening" tag and a
"closing" tag, possibly with attributes defined on the opening tag. A typical tag will look like this:

```
<!-- This is an HTML Comment! -->
<div class="some-class-name"> </div>
<!-- the `class="some-class-name"` part is "Attribute" -->
```

There are also "self-closing" tags. They look like this:

```
<!-- Notice there is no `</img>` on the end of this one? -->
<img src="http://placehold.it/1200x600/008aff/ffffff" alt="Placeholder image" />
```

### Debugging HTML

Using the Chrome DevTools (we'll talk more about those in a later section!), you can look at the structure of
HTML content on the page, as well as edit it live! Your edits won't be permanent, but it's nice to be able to tweak
your HTML right in the browser when designing an interface.

To open the DevTools:

1. Press `cmd + option + i` on Mac, or `ctrl + shift + i` on Windows
2. If you're not already there, navigate to the "Elements" tab.
3. You should now be able to see and work with the HTML!
